# PictureEdit - How to choose a visible image using the drag functionality


<p>This example demonstrates how to create a custom editor where a user can select what part of an image must be shown with the mouse. Please take special note that in Standalone mode it is better to use PictureEdit with the enabled ShowScrollbars property. This control provides the capability to use it in a grid without showing scrollbars.</p><br />
